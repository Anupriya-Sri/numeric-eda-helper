Exploratory data analysis package for data that is numeric in nature. The goal is to simply some common tasks during EDA and data preprocessing for data analysists. The package includes functions which can complete the following tasks:

- showing some useful statistics
- detecting outliers
- dealing with missing values
- checking for correlation between features  

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install numeric-eda-helper
```

## Similar Work

In the Python open source ecosystem, there already has some useful packages that can tackle EDA and preprocessing well, but our goal is to make it more light-weighted and fast. One popular and useful package that can generate a large EDA report is:
